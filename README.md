# Algorithm Time Complexity
This repository was created to show some algorithm complexity design problem. I started with a simple
sample using O(n^2) to O(1) optimization. Please feel free to send me other good examples.

## Modules
You can find each algorithm inside the "solution" package. Each module has its own solution
and a TestCase related (inside the "tests" package).

## Running the tests
Just run:
```
$ make [test]
```
Where **test** value can be **slow**, **fair** or **fast**.
